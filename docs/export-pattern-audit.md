# Export Pattern Audit

This document contains the results of a comprehensive audit of export patterns across the project, identifying inconsistencies and recommended changes.

## Summary of Findings

- **Page Components**: 3 page components using named exports instead of required default exports
- **UI Components**: 12 components using inconsistent export patterns
- **Hooks**: 5 hooks with inconsistent naming or export patterns
- **Context Providers**: 2 context providers using default exports instead of named exports
- **Utility Functions**: Multiple utility files with mixed export patterns

## Recommended Changes

### High Priority (Breaking Changes)

1. All page components in the `app/` directory must use default exports to comply with Next.js App Router requirements
2. Context providers should use named exports for better tree-shaking and to avoid import confusion

### Medium Priority (Consistency)

1. UI components should consistently use named exports
2. Hooks should use named exports and follow the "use" prefix naming convention
3. Utility functions should use named exports for better tree-shaking

### Low Priority (Optimization)

1. Consider using barrel exports (index.ts files) for related components
2. Optimize imports to reduce bundle size
