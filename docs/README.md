## Recent Changes

We've recently updated our export patterns to ensure consistency across the codebase and compliance with Next.js App Router conventions. Key changes include:

1. All page components now use default exports
2. Profile-related components (`ProfileSettings`, `UserPreferences`, `PasswordUpdate`) now use default exports
3. UI components continue to use named exports for better composability

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the [Export Patterns Guide](./export-patterns.md) to understand our conventions for component exports.

## Contributing

When contributing to the project, please follow the guidelines outlined in these documentation files to ensure consistency across the codebase.
